A quote by Hermann Hesse in _Schriften zur Literatur I_, published in 1970:

<blockquote>
<p>He who was captivated one day by a book, who begins to know and understand the author, who managed to establish a relationship with him, for him the book truly begins to have an effect. This is why he will not get rid of it, he will not forget it, but he will keep it, that is, he will buy it, to read and live in its pages whenever he wants. The one who buys like this, the one who always buys only those books that have touched his heart for their tone and spirit, will soon stop devouring reading blindly, and over time, will gather around him a circle of beloved, valuable works in which he will find joy and wisdom, and which will always be more valuable than a random, casual reading of everything that falls into his hands.</p>

<p>[&#8230;] [E]veryone has to follow their needs and their love and slowly acquire a collection of books as they acquire their friends. Then a small collection can mean the world to them. The best readers have always been precisely those who limited their needs to very few books [&#8230;].</p>

<p>[&#8230;] [T]here is only one law and one way to cultivate oneself and grow intellectually with books, and it is the respect for what one is reading, the patience to want to understand, the humility to tolerate, to listen. He who only reads as a pastime, no matter how much and how good is what he reads, will read and forget and then he will be as poor as before. But for him who reads as one listens to friends, the books will reveal their riches and become his own. What he reads will not slip, nor will it be lost, but will stay with him an belong to him and comfort him, as only friends are able to do.</p>
</blockquote>

A reminder of the value of investing more time to the content we consume, choosing more carefully and having the patience to _live in the pages_ and develop a more profound understanding.

I have a tendency to reading a lot of content, some of it casually, and gathering a lot of books, articles and podcasts. And there is certainly value in maintaining a broad view, exploring different topics and reading several diverse works, as opposed to limiting the content we consume. But it is only through focus and careful reflection that the content ultimately enriches us and becomes valuable. Over time, I've found out that writing about what I read or listen to helps me develop this clarity and, more often than not, leads to valuable insights.

Thanks to <a href="https://lecturia.org/" target='_blank'>lecturia.org</a> for collecting this and other essays and stories by authors of classic literature._</small>
